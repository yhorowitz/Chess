# Chess

A standard chess game played between 2 players. There is no plan to allow the user to play against an AI. This will not be network (although theoretically it should be relatively simple to write a separate networked version based around this code). The GUI will start off as 2D but we will try to make a 3D version as well based off of the same code.

######Planned Features:

- The game history will be shown (it will have an option to be hidden).
- Captured pieces will be shown (In the mysterious and dangerous Ancient Chess Graveyard).

The art for the chess pieces were taken from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece
